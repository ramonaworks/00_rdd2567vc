<div class="container">
<p class="eyebrow mb-3">What people feel on flights</p>

<div class="row align-items-start g-4">
<div class="col-lg-8">

<p class="hero-copy mb-2">
Flying compresses stress into small moments. A sudden bump. A missed announcement. A long wait. For many people, it is not fear of flying. It is lack of control, social isolation, and not knowing what is normal. Most travelers do not want to "make a scene." They want a quiet reset.
</p>

<p class="hero-copy mb-2">
Today's options are either too official to be human (airline comms) or too public to feel safe (social media). Ramona Board sits in the middle. A temporary room with strangers who share the same context. It supports simple reassurance ("normal turbulence"), distraction ("what are you watching"), and practical coordination ("anyone on the layover want to grab a drink").
</p>

<p class="eyebrow mt-5">Key pattern identified</p>  
<p class="text-secondary">
When people are stressed, they seek quick relief with low effort and high certainty. A flight-scoped room reduces uncertainty and social friction. It helps people return to calm faster. That same moment also creates sponsor value. A traveler who just regulated their stress is more open to a helpful perk that fits the moment, like a bonus miles offer or a pickup deal at the arrival terminal.

    <p class="text-secondary small my-3">
            Airlines and airport brands can offer optional, location and flight-relevant perks. Think bonus miles, lounge trials, in-terminal pickup deals, and quick bite offers. Passengers get value when they are most captive and most receptive. Sponsors get high-intent attention with clear attribution, without hijacking the core experience.

<h3 class="case-title mt-3">Monetization Opportunity</h3>
<p class="text-secondary">
We sell sponsored, opt-in moments to brands that already serve travelers. Airlines, airports, lounges, food, and retail partners. The unit is a flight room with verified context. Sponsors can target by route, airport, terminal, and time window. Every offer routes to an official sponsor destination, so trust stays intact.
</p>

<h3 class="case-title mt-3">Transformation for travelers and sponsors</h3>
<ul class="text-secondary">
  <li>
    <strong>Travelers.</strong> Before, alone, tense, and guessing. After, reassured, distracted, and connected, with a helpful perk that makes the layover or arrival easier. It feels like the internet got kinder for two hours.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sponsors.</strong> Before, ads compete with everything and feel random. After, a perk appears at the exact moment it matters, inside a shared travel context. Higher intent, clear attribution, and better brand sentiment because it reads as help, not interruption.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3 class="case-title mt-3">Why it can be big</h3>
<p class="text-secondary">
Air travel has massive volume and repeated behavior. The product is lightweight and scales per flight. The monetization scales with sponsor inventory per airport, per route, and per season. We can expand from chat to richer "in-flight calm" tools, airport wayfinding, and pickup flows without changing the core promise.
</p>

<h3 class="case-title mt-3">Trust and risk controls</h3>
<p class="text-secondary">
We keep the room safe with simple boundaries. Temporary identity. Easy exit. Report and block. Clear disclaimers that redirect to crew for anything urgent or official. Offers are separated from conversation and never impersonate the airline.
</p>
